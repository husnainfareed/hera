# hera

Hera is a web application that combats sexism in healthcare through using a deep learning algorithm to efficiently and effectively predict a patient's chances of having heart disease. By developing an algorithm that is free from systemic bias, Hera provides a more accurate prediction of a patient's chances of having heart disease than a physician.
